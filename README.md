## Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability

This repository shares the learning process of course 6.041 with online materials from MIT OCW. The results are divided into the following two parts:

1. Lecture notes (in Markdown)
   - Including a final review (only in Chinese now)
2. Quizzes' hand-written solutions
   - They may be converted to Markdown in the future.
